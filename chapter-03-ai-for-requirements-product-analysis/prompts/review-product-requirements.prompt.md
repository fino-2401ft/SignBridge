# P3.2 — Review product requirements

> - **Role:** REVIEW GATE
> - **Skills:** `$prd-generator` (required: PRD completeness and structure), `$brainstorm` (conditional: a finding needs a product decision)
> - **Interaction mode:** inspect-and-report
> - **Output mode:** review findings
> - **Approval gate:** accept findings before changing the canonical PRD
> - **Updates:** `chapter-03-ai-for-requirements-product-analysis/docs/product-requirements.md` after human review
> - **Run context:** fresh session; attach or provide every input below.

## Use this when

You have a PRD draft and need to decide whether it is ready to drive a feature specification.

## Inputs

- PRD draft: [product-requirements.md](../docs/product-requirements.md)
- Project context: [project-context.md](../../chapter-02-prompt-engineering/docs/project-context.md)
- Any newer human-approved product decision.

## Task

Use `$prd-generator` to inspect requirement completeness and testability. Review product value, source support, registration/login, permission clarity, validation, error recovery, persistence, terminology, and exclusions.

Return findings first. For every confirmed issue, give the smallest correction and distinguish it from an open human question. Use `$brainstorm` only to resolve a material product choice with the human. Do not rewrite the canonical PRD until the human accepts the findings.

## Constraints and source precedence

1. Newer human-approved decisions.
2. Project context.
3. PRD draft.
4. AI suggestions.

- Do not reward document length or add features while reviewing.
- Preserve accepted exclusions.
- Reject password reset, SSO, sharing, and unsupported scope unless a supplied decision approves it.

## Expected output

A prioritized findings list containing: evidence, impact, target section, smallest correction, and status (`confirmed issue` or `human decision needed`).

## Save or update

Do not create a separate canonical review document. After human approval, apply accepted corrections to `product-requirements.md`; leave rejected or deferred findings out of the PRD.

## Human review required

The human accepts, rejects, or defers each finding before the PRD changes.

## Validation checklist

- No requirement depends on MCP.
- No planned feature is presented as delivered.
- Main and failure journeys are testable.
- Terminology is consistent.
